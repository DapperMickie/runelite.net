## New UI Look and Feel

We've recently completed a large overhaul of our UI, the first change since [2018](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-05-24-1.4.0-Release).
This allows native Window snapping support on Windows 10 and 11, on MacOS uses the native titlebar, and fixes inconsistent maximize behavior when using multiple displays of different scaling factors. The titlebar and tray icon has also been updated to a new pixelart version of the logo thanks to `con_no_1`.

Additionally I would like to apologize for how bumpy this update was. We went through several iterations of update & rollback between January 13 and 30 which you might have noticed, causing the client to switch between the old and new L&F multiple times. While we do rollbacks occasionally, applying this to the UI updates caused a lot more consternation due to the changes being so visible. Many of the issues brought to our attention were changes to behaviors that we didn't know we had or that people relied upon. We have since fixed back the behaviors of everything that we can reasonably do.

### Player menu collapsing

The interface styles plugin has a new option to place player menu options into a submenu, similar to RuneScape.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- You can now locate all your dashing clue gear that is storable in the POH treasure chest with the new `treasure chest` bank tag, freeing up bank space!
- US servers now show east or west on the world hopper.
- Time tracking now correctly tracks payment to any farmer, instead of only to ones with a single patch.
- The `Window opacity` setting now works on more systems (MacOS/Linux) and also with custom chrome off.
- The wiki plugin adds a `View DPS` button to the equipment screen to open the [OSRS Wiki DPS calculator](https://tools.runescape.wiki/osrs-dps/) with your current gear.
- Tree respawn timers now use the Jagex respawn timers.
- The message from the NPC unaggression plugin being uncalibrated is now an infobox.
- Camera speed can now be adjusted in the camera plugin.
- Custom notification volume can now be adjusted under notification settings.
- Group ironman shared storage can now be searched using the search hotkey.
- Loot tracking for the Nightmare and Phosani's Nightmare has been fixed.
- A bug causing KC/PB tracking of 6+ size TOA teams to record the wrong team size has been fixed.
- The chat filter plugin has been optimized to no longer cause lag with an excessively large regex filter list.

Enjoy!
